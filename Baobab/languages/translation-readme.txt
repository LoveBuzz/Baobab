=== BAOBAB TRANSLATIONS : NOTE ===

Currently we have the translation to English, but if you want to improve this or create a new one, you can do it using poEdit [http://www.poedit.net/ - available for Windows, Mac and Linux]. The original words are in "messages.po"

If you do, you might want to send it to the Baobab's Github at https://github.com/joacomartel/Baobab so others can also use your
translation.
